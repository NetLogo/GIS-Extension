Defines a mapping between GIS coordinates and NetLogo coordinates.
The *gis-envelope* and *netlogo-envelope* parameters must

The scale of the transformation will be equal to the minimum of the
scale necessary to make the mapping between the ranges of x values
and the scale necessary to make the mapping between the ranges of y
values. The GIS space will be centered in NetLogo space.

(latitude and longitude) space in degrees to NetLogo world space,
regardless of the current dimensions of the NetLogo world:

```

will cause distortion of the shape of GIS features, and so it is

Reports true if the spatial representations of the two objects have
the given spatial relationship, and false otherwise. The spatial
relationship is specified using a **Dimensionally Extended Nine-
Intersection Model (DE-9IM)** matrix. The matrix consists of 9
elements, each of which specifies the required relationship between
the two objects' interior space, boundary space, or exterior
space. The elements must have one of six possible values:

* "T", meaning the spaces must intersect in some way
* "F", meaning the spaces must not intersect in any way
* "0", meaning the dimension of the spaces'
  intersection must be zero (i.e., it must be a point or non-empty
  set of points).
* "1", meaning the dimension of the spaces'
  intersection must be one (i.e., it must be a line or non-empty set
  of line segments).
* "2", meaning the dimension of the spaces'
  intersection must be two (i.e., it must be a polygon or set of
  polygons whose area is greater than zero).
* "*", meaning that the two spaces may have any
  relationship.

For example, this matrix:
      <table width="50%" border="1" style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;">
<tr>
  <td rowspan="2" colspan="2">
  <td colspan="3">
    x

    y
  <td> Interior <td> T <td> * <td> * <tr>
  <td> Boundary <td> * <td> * <td> * <tr>
  <td> Exterior <td> F <td> F <td> * </table>

would return true if and only if some part of object *x*'s
interior lies inside object *y*'s interior, and no part of
object *x*'s interior or boundary intersects object
*y*'s exterior. This is essentially a more restrictive
form of the `contains?` primitive; one in which polygons are
not considered to contain their boundaries.

The matrix is given to the `have-relationship?` primitive as
a string, whose elements are given in the following order:
      <table width="25%" border="1" style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;" align="center">
<tr>
  <td> 1 <td> 2 <td> 3 <tr>
  <td> 4 <td> 5 <td> 6 <tr>
  <td> 7 <td> 8 <td> 9 </table>

So to use the example matrix above, you would write:

```
gis:have-relationship? x y "T*****FF*"
```

filter out "not a number" values. A value that is not a
