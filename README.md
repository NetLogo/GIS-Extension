# GIS Extension for NetLogo

This package contains the NetLogo GIS extension.

## Building

Use the netlogo.jar.url environment variable to tell sbt which NetLogo.jar to compile against (defaults to NetLogo 5.3). For example:

    sbt -Dnetlogo.jar.url=file:///path/to/NetLogo/target/NetLogo.jar package

If compilation succeeds, `gis.jar` will be created.

## Using

This extension adds GIS (Geographic Information Systems) support to
NetLogo. It provides the ability to load vector GIS data (points,
lines, and polygons), and raster GIS data (grids) into your model.

The extension supports vector data in the form of ESRI shapefiles.
The shapefile (.shp) format is the most common format for storing and
exchanging vector GIS data. The extension supports raster data in the
form of ESRI ASCII Grid files. The ASCII grid file (.asc or .grd) is
not as common as the shapefile, but is supported as an interchange
format by most GIS platforms.

### How to use

In general, you first define a transformation between GIS data space
and NetLogo space, then load datasets and perform various operations
on them. The easiest way to define a transformation between GIS space
and NetLogo space is to take the union of the "envelopes"
or bounding rectangles of all of your datasets in GIS space and map
that directly to the bounds of the NetLogo world. See GIS General
Examples for an example of this technique.

You may also optionally define a projection for the GIS space, in
which case datasets will be re-projected to match that projection as
they are loaded, as long as each of your data files has an associated
.prj file that describes the projection or geographic coordinate
system of the data. If no associated .prj file is found, the
extension will assume that the dataset already uses the current
projection, regardless of what that projection is.

Once the coordinate system is defined, you can load datasets using
[gis:load-dataset](#gisload-dataset). This primitive
reports either a VectorDataset or a RasterDataset, depending on what
type of file you pass it.

A VectorDataset consists of a collection of VectorFeatures, each one
of which is a point, line, or polygon, along with a set of property
values. A single VectorDataset may contain only one of the three
possible types of features.

There are several things you can do with a VectorDataset: ask it for
the names of the properties of its features, ask it for its
"envelope" (bounding rectangle), ask for a list of all
VectorFeatures in the dataset, search for a single VectorFeature or
list of VectorFeatures whose value for a particular property is less
than or greater than a particular value, or lies within a given
range, or matches a given string using wildcard matching
("*", which matches any number of occurrences of any
characters). If the VectorFeatures are polygons, you can also apply
the values of a particular property of the dataset's features to
a given patch variable.

There are also several things you can do with a VectorFeature from a
VectorDataset: ask it for a list of vertex lists, ask it for a
property value by name, ask it for its centroid (center of gravity),
and ask for a subset of a given agentset whose agents intersect the
given VectorFeature. For point data, each vertex list will be a
one-element list. For line data, each vertex list will represent the
vertices of a line that makes up that feature. For polygon data, each
vertex list will represent one "ring" of the polygon, and
the first and last vertex of the list will be the same. The vertex
lists are made up of values of type Vertex, and the centroid will be
a value of type Vertex as well.

There are a number of operations defined for RasterDatasets as well.
Mostly these involve sampling the values in the dataset, or
re-sampling a raster to a different resolution. You can also apply a
raster to a given patch variable, and convolve a raster using an
arbitrary convolution matrix.

### Known Issues


Values of type RasterDataset, VectorDataset, VectorFeature, and
Vertex are not handled properly by `export-world` and
`import-world`. To save datasets, you must use the
`gis:store-dataset` primitive.

There is currently no way to distinguish positive-area
"shell" polygons from negative-area "hole"
polygons, or to determine which holes are associated with which
shells.

### `gis:set-transformation`

```NetLogo
gis:set-transformation *gis-envelope* *netlogo-envelope*
```


Defines a mapping between GIS coordinates and NetLogo coordinates.
The *gis-envelope* and *netlogo-envelope* parameters must
each be four-element lists consisting of:

```
[minimum-x maximum-x minimum-y maximum-y]
```

The scale of the transformation will be equal to the minimum of the
scale necessary to make the mapping between the ranges of x values
and the scale necessary to make the mapping between the ranges of y
values. The GIS space will be centered in NetLogo space.

For example, the following two lists would map all of geographic
(latitude and longitude) space in degrees to NetLogo world space,
regardless of the current dimensions of the NetLogo world:

```
(list -180 180 -90 90)
(list min-pxcor max-pxcor min-pycor max-pycor)
```

However, if you're setting the envelope of the NetLogo world,
you should probably be using [set-world-envelope](#gisset-world-envelope).



### `gis:set-transformation-ds`

```NetLogo
gis:set-transformation-ds *gis-envelope* *netlogo-envelope*
```


Does the same thing as [set-transformation](#gisset-transformation) above, except that
it allows the scale for mapping the range of x values to be
different than the scale for y values. The "-ds" on the
end stands for "different scales". Using different scales
will cause distortion of the shape of GIS features, and so it is
generally not recommended, but it may be useful for some models.

Here is an example of the difference between [set-transformation](#gisset-transformation) and [set-transformation-ds](#gisset-transformation-ds):

<table width="80%" border="1" rules="cols" style="border-collaps: separate; border-spacing: 4px; text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;">
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 8px">
    <img alt="" src="images/set-transformation.png" width="200">
  <td style="padding: 8px">
    <img alt="" src="images/set-transformation-ds.png" width="200">
  <tr>
  <td style="padding: 8px">
    Using [set-transformation](#gisset-transformation),
    the scale along the x and y axis is the same, preserving the
    round shape of the Earth in this Orthographic projection.
  <td style="padding: 8px">
    Using [set-transformation-ds](#gisset-transformation-ds), the
    scale along the x axis is stretched so that the earth covers
    the entire NetLogo View, which in this case distorts the shape
    of the Earth.
</table>



### `gis:set-world-envelope`

```NetLogo
gis:set-world-envelope *gis-envelope*
```


A shorthand for setting the transformation by mapping the envelope
of the NetLogo world to the given envelope in GIS space, while
keeping the scales along the x and y axis the same. It is
equivalent to:

```
set-transformation gis-envelope (list min-pxcor max-pxcor min-pycor max-pycor)
```

This primitive is supplied because most of the time you'll want
to set the envelope of the entire NetLogo world, rather than just a
part of it.



### `gis:set-world-envelope-ds`

```NetLogo
gis:set-world-envelope-ds *gis-envelope*
```


A shorthand for setting the transformation by mapping the envelope
of the NetLogo world to the given envelope in GIS space, using
different scales along the x and y axis if necessary. It is
equivalent to:

```
set-transformation-ds gis-envelope (list min-pxcor max-pxcor min-pycor max-pycor)
```

See the [pictures](#transformation-example) above for
the difference between using equal scales for x and y coordinates
and using different scales.



### `gis:world-envelope`

```NetLogo
gis:world-envelope
```


Reports the envelope (bounding rectangle) of the NetLogo world,
transformed into GIS space. An envelope consists of a four-element
list of the form:

```
[minimum-x maximum-x minimum-y maximum-y]
```




### `gis:envelope-of`

```NetLogo
gis:envelope-of *thing*
```


Reports the envelope (bounding rectangle) of *thing* in GIS
coordinates. The *thing* may be an Agent, an AgentSet, a
RasterDataset, a VectorDataset, or a VectorFeature. An envelope
consists of a four-element list of the form:

```
[minimum-x maximum-x minimum-y maximum-y]
```




### `gis:envelope-union-of`

```NetLogo
gis:envelope-union-of *envelope1* *envelope2*
(gis:envelope-union-of *envelope1...*)
```


Reports an envelope (bounding rectangle) that entirely contains the
given envelopes. An envelope consists of a four-element list of the
form

```
[minimum-x maximum-x minimum-y maximum-y]
```

No assumption is made about the coordinate system of the arguments,
though if they are not in the same coordinate system, results will
be unpredictable.



### `gis:load-coordinate-system`

```NetLogo
gis:load-coordinate-system *file*
```


Loads a new global projection used for projecting or re- projecting
GIS data as it is loaded from a file. The file must contain a valid
<a href="http://geoapi.sourceforge.net/2.0/javadoc/org/opengis/referencing/doc-files/WKT.html" target="_blank">
Well-Known Text (WKT)</a> projection description.

WKT projection files are frequently distributed alongside GIS data
files, and usually have a ".prj" filename extension.

Relative paths are resolved relative to the location of the current
model, or the user's home directory if the current model
hasn't been saved yet.

The GIS extension does not support all WKT coordinate systems and
projections. Only geographic (`"GEOGCS"`) and
projected (`"PROJCS"`) coordinate systems are
supported. For projected coordinate systems, only the following
projections are supported:

* Albers_Conic_Equal_Area
* Lambert_Conformal_Conic_2SP
* Polyconic
* Lambert_Azimuthal_Equal_Area
* Mercator_1SP
* Robinson
* Azimuthal_Equidistant
* Miller
* Stereographic
* Cylindrical_Equal_Area
* Oblique_Mercator
* Transverse_Mercator
* Equidistant_Conic
* hotine_oblique_mercator
* Gnomonic
* Orthographic

See <a href="http://remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/" target="_blank">remotesensing.org</a>
for a complete list of WKT projections and their parameters.



### `gis:set-coordinate-system`

```NetLogo
gis:set-coordinate-system *system*
```


Sets the global projection used for projecting or re- projecting
GIS data as it is loaded. The *system* must be either a string
in <a href="http://geoapi.sourceforge.net/2.0/javadoc/org/opengis/referencing/doc-files/WKT.html" target="_blank">
Well-Known Text (WKT) format</a>, or a NetLogo list that consists
of WKT converted to a list by moving each keyword inside its
associated brackets and putting quotes around it. The latter is
preferred because it makes the code much more readable.

The same limitations on WKT support apply as described above in the
documentation for [load-coordinate-system](#gisload-coordinate-system)



### `gis:project-lat-lon`

```NetLogo
gis:project-lat-lon *latitude* *longitude*
```


    Report the position, in NetLogo space, of the given latitude
    and longitude pair according to the current map projection and
    transformation. 

    Like the `location-of` primitive, the reported xcor and ycor
    values are reported in a two-item list of `[xcor ycor]` 
    and an empty list if the specified point is outside of 
    the bounds of the netlogo world. 
    For instance:
    ```
    let location-of-abbey-road-studios gis:project-lat-lon 51.5320787 -0.1802646
    let abbey-road-xcor item 0 location-of-abbey-road-studios
    let abbey-road-ycor item 1 location-of-abbey-road-studios
    ```

    Note that this primitive assumes that the given lat/lon pair 
    are relative to the WGS84 datum/ellipsoid. If your
    data is based on GPS observations or GeoJson files, then your 
    data is already relative to WGS84. If you are unsure about 
    what datum your data is, then you should probably just assume
    it is WGS84 and use this primitive. However, if you do know
    that your data is relative to a different datum and that
    extra degree of precision is important to you (if you are,
    say, comparing values from location-of and project-lat-lon)
    then you should use `project-lat-lon-from-ellipsoid` and 
    specify the desired datum's ellipsoid. 



### `gis:project-lat-lon-from-ellipsoid`

```NetLogo
gis:project-lat-lon-from-ellipsoid *latitude* *longitude* *ellipsoid-radius* *ellipsoid-inverse-flattening*
```


    Report the position, in NetLogo space, of the given latitude
    and longitude pair according to the current map projection and
    transformation and the given ellipsoid parameters. 

    Like the `location-of` primitive, the reported xcor and ycor
    values are reported in a two-item list of `[xcor ycor]`
    and an empty list if the specified point is outside of 
    the bounds of the netlogo world. 

    The two defining parameters of a  ellipsoid for 
    the purposes of this primitive are the radius and the 
    inverse flattening metric. These parameters can be 
    easily found by examining either the WKT definition
    of a given projection/datum pair or the .prj file for 
    the desired datum. For example, if you open the .prj file
    for a shapefile exported with the WGS66 datum in a text editor, 
    you will see, somewhere in the file, this bit of text:
    `DATUM["D_WGS_1966",SPHEROID["NWL_9D",6378145,298.25]]`. 
    If you look at the `SPHEROID` section of that text, the
    first number is the radius of that ellipoid and the 
    second is the inverse flattening. 

    Once we have these numbers, we can project data that is 
    relative to WGS66 like so:
    ```
    let location gis:project-lat-lon my-lat my-lon 6378145 298.25
    ```

    For more on earth ellipoids, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_ellipsoid



### `gis:load-dataset`

```NetLogo
gis:load-dataset *file*
```


Loads the given data file, re-projecting the data as necessary. 

For ESRI shapefiles and ESRI grid files, if there is a ".prj" file 
associated with the file, then `load-datset` will consult that file
and re-project to the current global projection if needed. If no ".prj"
file is found, then the data is assumed to use the same projection as
the current global coordinate system.

For GeoJSON files, as per the most-recent specification (RFC 7946), 
the coordinate system for GeoJSON files is always WGS84 and will be 
imported accordingly. 

Currently, three types of data file are supported:

* "**.shp**" (ESRI shapefile): contains vector data,
  consisting of points, lines, or polygons. When the target file is a
  shapefile, `load-dataset` reports a VectorDataset.
* "**.asc**" or "**.grd**" (ESRI ASCII grid):
  contains raster data, consisting of a grid of values. When
  the target file is an ASCII grid file, `load-dataset`
  reports a RasterDataset.
* "**.geojson**" or "**.json**" (GeoJSON): contains vector data 
  similar to shapefiles and similarly reports a VectorDataset. 

Note that not all aspects of the GeoJSON standard are supported. 
In particular, to be properly imported, a GeoJSON file must 
satisfy the following: 

* It only contain numeric or string data within the properties. 
  all other json data will be stringified. 
* All "Features" within a "FeatureCollection" must be of the same
  shape type ("Point", "LineString", etc.) and must all contain 
  the same set of property names and datatypes. i.e, if one feature
  has a "population" property with a numeric value, all the other
  features within that collection must also have a "population"
  property with a numeric value. 
* It must not use "GeometryCollection", which is not supported
  



### `gis:store-dataset`

```NetLogo
gis:store-dataset *dataset* *file*
```


Saves the given dataset to the given file. If the name of the file
does not have the proper file extension, the extension will be
automatically appended to the name. Relative paths are resolved
relative to the location of the current model, or the user's
home directory if the current model hasn't been saved yet.

Currently, this primitive only works for RasterDatasets, and it can
only save those datasets as ESRI ASCII grid files.



### `gis:type-of`

```NetLogo
gis:type-of *dataset*
```

Reports the type of the given GIS dataset: either "VECTOR" or "RASTER"


### `gis:patch-dataset`

```NetLogo
gis:patch-dataset *patch-variable*
```


Reports a new raster whose cells correspond directly to NetLogo
patches, and whose cell values consist of the values of the given
patch variable. This primitive is basically the inverse of [apply-raster](#gisapply-raster);
`apply-raster` copies values from a raster dataset to a patch variable, while this
primitive copies values from a patch variable to a raster dataset.



### `gis:turtle-dataset`

```NetLogo
gis:turtle-dataset *turtle-set*
```


Reports a new, point VectorDataset built from the turtles in the
given agentset. The points are located at locations of the turtles,
translated from NetLogo space into GIS space using the current
coordinate transformation. And the dataset's properties consist
of all of the turtle variables common to every turtle in the
agentset.



### `gis:link-dataset`

```NetLogo
gis:link-dataset *link-set*
```


Reports a new, line VectorDataset built from the links in the given
agentset. The endpoints of each line are at the location of the
turtles connected by each link, translated from NetLogo space into
GIS space using the current coordinate transformation. And the
dataset's properties consist of all of the link variables
common to every link in the agentset.



### `gis:shape-type-of`

```NetLogo
gis:shape-type-of *VectorDataset*
```


Reports the shape type of the given dataset. The possible output
values are "POINT", "LINE", and "POLYGON".


### `gis:property-names`

```NetLogo
gis:property-names *VectorDataset*
```


Reports a list of strings where each string is the name of a
property possessed by each VectorFeature in the given
VectorDataset, suitable for use in [gis:property-value](#gisproperty-value).



### `gis:feature-list-of`

```NetLogo
gis:feature-list-of *VectorDataset*
```

Reports a list of all VectorFeatures in the given dataset.


### `gis:vertex-lists-of`

```NetLogo
gis:vertex-lists-of *VectorFeature*
```


Reports a list of lists of Vertex values. For point datasets, each
vertex list will contain exactly one vertex: the location of a
point. For line datasets, each vertex list will contain at least
two points, and will represent a "polyline", connecting
each adjacent pair of vertices in the list. For polygon datasets,
each vertex list will contain at least three points, representing a
polygon connecting each vertex, and the first and last vertices in
the list will be the same.



### `gis:centroid-of`

```NetLogo
gis:centroid-of *VectorFeature*
```


Reports a single Vertex representing the centroid (center of
gravity) of the given feature. For point datasets, the centroid is
defined as the average location of all points in the feature. For
line datasets, the centroid is defined as the average of the
locations of the midpoints of all line segments in the feature,
weighted by segment length. For polygon datasets, the centroid is
defined as the weighted sum of the centroids of a decomposition of
the area into (possibly overlapping) triangles. See <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/graphics/algorithms-faq/" target="_blank">this FAQ</a>
for more details on the polygon centroid algorithm.



### `gis:location-of`

```NetLogo
gis:location-of *Vertex*
```


Reports a two-element list containing the x and y values (in that
order) of the given vertex translated into NetLogo world space
using the current transformation, or an empty list if the given
vertex lies outside the NetLogo world.



### `gis:property-value`

```NetLogo
gis:property-value *VectorFeature* *property-name*
```


Reports the value of the property with the given name for the given
VectorDataset. The reported value may be a number, a string, or a
boolean value, depending on the type of the field in the underlying
data file.

For shapefiles, values from dBase `CHARACTER` and
`DATE` fields are returned as strings, values from
`NUMBER` and `FLOAT` fields are returned as numbers,
and values from `LOGICAL` fields are returned as boolean
values. `MEMO` fields are not supported. `DATE`
values are converted to strings using ISO 8601 format
(`YYYY-MM-DD`).



### `gis:find-features`

```NetLogo
gis:find-features *VectorDataset* *property-name* *specified-value*
```


Reports a list of all VectorFeatures in the given dataset whose
value for the property *property-name* matches *specified-value* (a string).
Value comparison is not case sensitive, and the wildcard
character "*" will match any number of occurrences
(including zero) of any character.



### `gis:find-one-feature`

```NetLogo
gis:find-one-feature *VectorDataset* *property-name* *specified-value*
```


Reports the first VectorFeature in the dataset whose value for the
property *property-name* matches the given string. Value
comparison is not case sensitive, and the wildcard character
"*" will match any number of occurrences (including zero)
of any character. Features are searched in the order that they
appear in the data file that was the source of the dataset, and
searching stops as soon as a match is found. Reports
`nobody` if no matching VectorFeature is found.



### `gis:find-less-than`

```NetLogo
gis:find-less-than *VectorDataset* *property-name* *value*
```


Reports a list of all VectorFeatures in the given dataset whose
value for the property *property-name* is less than the given
*value*. String values are compared using case-sensitive
lexicographic order as defined in the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#compareTo(java.lang.String)" target="_blank">
Java Documentation</a>. Using a string value for a numeric property
or a numeric value for a string property will cause an error.



### `gis:find-greater-than`

```NetLogo
gis:find-greater-than *VectorDataset* *property-name* *value*
```


Reports a list of all VectorFeatures in the given dataset whose
value for the property *property-name* is greater than the
given *value*. String values are compared using case-sensitive
lexicographic order as defined in the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#compareTo(java.lang.String)" target="_blank">
Java Documentation</a>. Using a string value for a numeric property
or a numeric value for a string property will cause an error.



### `gis:find-range`

```NetLogo
gis:find-range *VectorDataset* *property-name* *minimum-value* *maximum-value*
```


Reports a list of all VectorFeatures in the given dataset whose
value for the property *property-name* is strictly greater
than *minimum-value* and strictly less than
*maximum-value*. String values are compared using
case-sensitive lexicographic order as defined in the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#compareTo(java.lang.String)" target="_blank">
Java Documentation</a>. Using a string value for a numeric property
or a numeric value for a string property will cause an error.



### `gis:property-minimum`

```NetLogo
gis:property-minimum *VectorDataset* *property-name*
```


Reports the smallest value for the given property over all of the
VectorFeatures in the given dataset. String values are compared
using case-sensitive lexicographic order as defined in the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#compareTo(java.lang.String)" target="_blank">
Java Documentation</a>.



### `gis:property-maximum`

```NetLogo
gis:property-maximum *VectorDataset* *property-name*
```


Reports the largest value for the given property over all of the
VectorFeatures in the given dataset. String values are compared
using case-sensitive lexicographic order as defined in the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#compareTo(java.lang.String)" target="_blank">
Java Documentation</a>.



### `gis:apply-coverage`

```NetLogo
gis:apply-coverage *VectorDataset* *property-name* *patch-variable*
```


Copies values from the given property of the VectorDataset's
features to the given patch variable. The dataset must be a
`polygon` dataset; points and lines are not supported.

For each patch, it finds all VectorFeatures that intersect that
patch. Then, if the property is a string property, it computes the
majority value by computing the total area of the patch covered by
VectorFeatures having each possible value of the property, then
returning the value which represents the largest proportion of the
patch area. If the property is a numeric property, it computes a
weighted average of property values from all VectorFeatures which
intersect the patch, weighted by the proportion of the patch area
they cover.

There are two exceptions to this default behavior:

* If a percentage of a patches' area greater than the
  coverage-maximum-threshold is covered by a single VectorFeature,
  then the property value from that VectorFeature is copied directly.
  If more than one VectorFeature covers a percentage of area greater
  than the threshold, only the first will be used.

* If the total percentage of a patches' area covered by
  VectorFeatures is less than the coverage-minimum-threshold, the
  target patch variable is set to Not A Number.

By default, the minimum threshold is 10% and the maximum threshold
is 33%. These values may be modified using the four primitives that
follow.



### `gis:coverage-minimum-threshold`

gis:coverage-minimum-threshold
```

Reports the current coverage minimum threshold used by [gis:apply-coverage](#gisapply-coverage).

```

Sets the current coverage maximum threshold to be used by [gis:apply-coverage](#gisapply-coverage).


### `gis:intersects?`

```NetLogo
gis:intersects? *x* *y*
```


Reports true if the given objects' spatial representations
share at least one point in common, and false otherwise. The
objects x and y may be any one of:

* a VectorDataset, in which case the object's spatial
    representation is the union of all the points, lines, or polygons
    the dataset contains.
* a VectorFeature, in which case the object's spatial
    representation is defined by the point, line, or polygon the
    feature contains.
* A turtle, in which case the spatial representation is a point.
* A link, whose spatial representation is a line segment
  connecting the two points represented by the turtles the link is
  connecting.
* A patch, whose spatial representation is a rectangular polygon.
* An agentset, whose spatial representation is the union of the
  representations of all of the agents it contains.
* A list containing of any of the items listed here, including
  another list. The spatial representation of such a list is the
  union of the spatial representations of its contents.



### `gis:contains?`

```NetLogo
gis:contains? *x* *y*
```


Reports true if every point of *y*'s spatial
representation is also a part of *x*'s spatial
representation. Note that this means that polygons do contain their
boundaries. The objects x and y may be any one of

* a VectorDataset, in which case the object's spatial
  representation is the union of all the points, lines, or polygons
  the dataset contains.
* a VectorFeature, in which case the object's spatial
  representation is defined by the point, line, or polygon the
  feature contains.
* A turtle, in which case the spatial representation is a point.
* A link, whose spatial representation is a line segment
  connecting the two points represented by the turtles the link is
  connecting.
* A patch, whose spatial representation is a rectangular polygon.
* An agentset, whose spatial representation is the union of the
  representations of all of the agents it contains.
* A list containing of any of the items listed here, including
  another list. The spatial representation of such a list is the
  union of the spatial representations of its contents.



### `gis:contained-by?`

```NetLogo
gis:contained-by? *x* *y*
```


Reports true if every point of *x*'s spatial
representation is also a part of *y*'s spatial
representation. The objects x and y may be any one of:

* a VectorDataset, in which case the object's spatial
  representation is the union of all the points, lines, or polygons
  the dataset contains.
* a VectorFeature, in which case the object's spatial
  representation is defined by the point, line, or polygon the
  feature contains.
* A turtle, in which case the spatial representation is a point.
* A link, whose spatial representation is a line segment
  connecting the two points represented by the turtles the link is
  connecting.
* A patch, whose spatial representation is a rectangular polygon.
* An agentset, whose spatial representation is the union of the
  representations of all of the agents it contains.
* A list containing of any of the items listed here, including
  another list. The spatial representation of such a list is the
  union of the spatial representations of its contents.



### `gis:have-relationship?`

```NetLogo
gis:have-relationship? *x* *y*
```


Reports true if the spatial representations of the two objects have
the given spatial relationship, and false otherwise. The spatial
relationship is specified using a **Dimensionally Extended Nine-
Intersection Model (DE-9IM)** matrix. The matrix consists of 9
elements, each of which specifies the required relationship between
the two objects' interior space, boundary space, or exterior
space. The elements must have one of six possible values:

* "T", meaning the spaces must intersect in some way
* "F", meaning the spaces must not intersect in any way
* "0", meaning the dimension of the spaces'
  intersection must be zero (i.e., it must be a point or non-empty
  set of points).
* "1", meaning the dimension of the spaces'
  intersection must be one (i.e., it must be a line or non-empty set
  of line segments).
* "2", meaning the dimension of the spaces'
  intersection must be two (i.e., it must be a polygon or set of
  polygons whose area is greater than zero).
* "*", meaning that the two spaces may have any
  relationship.

For example, this matrix:
      <table width="50%" border="1" style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;">
<tr>
  <td rowspan="2" colspan="2">
  <td colspan="3">
    x
  <tr>
  <td> Interior <td> Boundary <td> Exterior <tr>
  <td rowspan="3">
    y
  <td> Interior <td> T <td> * <td> * <tr>
  <td> Boundary <td> * <td> * <td> * <tr>
  <td> Exterior <td> F <td> F <td> * </table>

would return true if and only if some part of object *x*'s
interior lies inside object *y*'s interior, and no part of
object *x*'s interior or boundary intersects object
*y*'s exterior. This is essentially a more restrictive
form of the `contains?` primitive; one in which polygons are
not considered to contain their boundaries.

The matrix is given to the `have-relationship?` primitive as
a string, whose elements are given in the following order:
      <table width="25%" border="1" style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;" align="center">
<tr>
  <td> 1 <td> 2 <td> 3 <tr>
  <td> 4 <td> 5 <td> 6 <tr>
  <td> 7 <td> 8 <td> 9 </table>

So to use the example matrix above, you would write:

```
gis:have-relationship? x y "T*****FF*"
```

A much more detailed and formal description of the DE-9IM matrix
and the associated point-set theory can be found in the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs" target="_blank">OpenGIS Simple
Features Specification for SQL</a>.

The objects x and y may be any one of:

* a VectorDataset, in which case the object's spatial
  representation is the union of all the points, lines, or polygons
  the dataset contains.
* a VectorFeature, in which case the object's spatial
  representation is defined by the point, line, or polygon the
  feature contains.
* A turtle, in which case the spatial representation is a point.
* A link, whose spatial representation is a line segment
  connecting the two points represented by the turtles the link is
  connecting.
* A patch, whose spatial representation is a rectangular polygon.
* An agentset, whose spatial representation is the union of the
  representations of all of the agents it contains.
* A list containing of any of the items listed here, including
  another list. The spatial representation of such a list is the
  union of the spatial representations of its contents.



### `gis:relationship-of`

```NetLogo
gis:relationship-of *x* *y*
```


Reports the **Dimensionally Extended Nine-Intersection Model
(DE-9IM)** matrix that describes the spatial relationship of the
two objects. The matrix consists of 9 elements, each of which
describes the relationship between the two objects' interior
space, boundary space, or exterior space. Each element will
describe the dimension of the intersection of two spaces, meaning
that it may have one of four possible values:

* "-1", meaning the spaces do not intersect
* "0", meaning the dimension of the spaces'
  intersection is zero (i.e., they intersect at a point or set of
  points).
* "1", meaning the dimension of the spaces'
  intersection is one (i.e., they intersect along one or more lines).
* "2", meaning the dimension of the spaces'
  intersection is two (i.e., their intersection is a non-empty
  polygon).


For example, the two polygons x and y shown here:
<center>
  <img alt="" src="images/intersecting-polygons.png">
</center>

have the following DE-9IM matrix:
<table width="50%" border="1" style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;" align="center">
  <tr>
  <td rowspan="2" colspan="2">
  <td colspan="3">
    x
  <tr>
  <td> Interior <td> Boundary <td> Exterior <tr>
  <td rowspan="3">
    y
  <td> Interior <td> 2 <td> 1 <td> 2 <tr>
  <td> Boundary <td> 1 <td> 0 <td> 1 <tr>
  <td> Exterior <td> 2 <td> 1 <td> 2 </table>

Which would be reported by the `relationship-of` primitive
as the string "212101212".

A much more detailed and formal description of the DE-9IM matrix
and the associated point-set theory can be found in the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs" target="_blank">OpenGIS Simple
Features Specification for SQL</a>.

The objects x and y may be any one of:

* a VectorDataset, in which case the object's spatial
  representation is the union of all the points, lines, or polygons
  the dataset contains.
* a VectorFeature, in which case the object's spatial
  representation is defined by the point, line, or polygon the
  feature contains.
* A turtle, in which case the spatial representation is a point.
* A link, whose spatial representation is a line segment
  connecting the two points represented by the turtles the link is
  connecting.
* A patch, whose spatial representation is a rectangular polygon.
* An agentset, whose spatial representation is the union of the
  representations of all of the agents it contains.
* A list containing of any of the items listed here, including
  another list. The spatial representation of such a list is the
  union of the spatial representations of its contents.



### `gis:intersecting`

```NetLogo
gis:intersecting *patch-set* *data*
```


Reports a new agent set containing only those members of the given
agent set which intersect given GIS *data*, which may be any
one of: a VectorDataset, a VectorFeature, an Agent, an Agent Set,
or a list containing any of the above.



### `gis:width-of`

```NetLogo
gis:width-of *RasterDataset*
```


Reports the number of columns in the dataset. Note that this is the
number of cells from left to right, not the width of the dataset in
GIS space.



### `gis:height-of`

```NetLogo
gis:height-of *RasterDataset*
```


Reports the number of rows in the dataset. Note that this is the
number of cells from top to bottom, not the height of the dataset
in GIS space.



### `gis:raster-value`

```NetLogo
gis:raster-value *RasterDataset* *x* *y*
```


Reports the value of the given raster dataset in the given cell.
Cell coordinates are numbered from left to right, and from top to
bottom, beginning with zero. So the upper left cell is (0, 0), and
the bottom right cell is (`gis:width-of dataset` - 1,
`gis:height-of dataset` - 1).



### `gis:set-raster-value`

```NetLogo
gis:set-raster-value *RasterDataset* *x* *y* *value*
```


Sets the value of the given raster dataset at the given cell to a
new value. Cell coordinates are numbered from left to right, and
from top to bottom, beginning with zero. So the upper left cell is
(0, 0), and the bottom right cell is (`gis:width-of dataset`
- 1, `gis:height-of dataset` - 1).



### `gis:minimum-of`

```NetLogo
gis:minimum-of *RasterDataset*
```

Reports the highest value in the given raster dataset.


### `gis:maximum-of`

```NetLogo
gis:maximum-of *RasterDataset*
```

Reports the lowest value in the given raster dataset.


### `gis:sampling-method-of`

```NetLogo
gis:sampling-method-of *RasterDataset*
```


Reports the sampling method used to compute the value of the given
raster dataset at a single point, or over an area smaller than a
single raster cell. Sampling is performed by the GIS extension
primitives [raster-sample](#gisraster-sample), [resample](#gisresample), [convolve](#gisconvolve),
and [apply-raster](#gisapply-raster). The sampling
method will be one of the following:

* `"NEAREST_NEIGHBOR"`: the value of the cell
  nearest the sampling location is used.
* `"BILINEAR"`: the value of the four nearest
  cells are sampled by linear weighting, according to their
  proximity to the sampling site.
* `"BICUBIC"`: the value of the sixteen nearest
  cells are sampled, and their values are combined by weight
  according to a piecewise cubic polynomial recommended by Rifman
  (see *Digital Image Warping*, George Wolberg, 1990, pp
  129-131, IEEE Computer Society Press).
* `"BICUBIC_2"`: the value is sampled using the
  same procedure and the same polynomial as with `BICUBIC`
  above, but using a different coefficient. This method may produce
  somewhat sharper results than `BICUBIC`, but that result
  is data dependent.

For more information on these sampling methods and on raster
sampling in general, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling" target="_blank">this wikipedia
article</a>.



### `gis:set-sampling-method`

```NetLogo
gis:set-sampling-method *RasterDataset* *sampling-method*
```


Sets the sampling method used by the given raster dataset at a
single point, or over an area smaller than a single raster cell.
Sampling is performed by the GIS extension primitives [raster-sample](#gisraster-sample), [resample](#gisresample), [convolve](#gisconvolve),
and [apply-raster](#gisapply-raster). The sampling
method must be one of the following:

*  `"NEAREST_NEIGHBOR"`
*  `"BILINEAR"`
*  `"BICUBIC"`
*  `"BICUBIC_2"`

See [sampling-method-of](#gissampling-method-of) above
for a more specific description of each sampling method.



### `gis:raster-sample`

```NetLogo
gis:raster-sample *RasterDataset* *sample-location*
```


Reports the value of the given raster over the given location. The
location may be any of the following:

* A list of length 2, which is taken to represent a point in
  netlogo space (`[xcor ycor]`) of the sort reported by
  [location-of](#gislocation-of) Vertex. The raster
  dataset is sampled at the point of that location.
* A list of length 4, which is taken to represent an envelope in
  GIS space, of the sort reported by [envelope-of](#gisenvelope-of). The raster dataset is sampled
  over the area of that envelope.
* A patch, in which case the raster dataset is sampled over the
  area of the patch.
* A turtle, in which case the raster dataset is sampled at the
  location of that turtle.
* A Vertex, in which case the raster dataset is sampled at the
  location of that Vertex.

If the requested location is outside the area covered by the raster
dataset, this primitive reports the special value representing
"not a number", which is printed by NetLogo as
"NaN". Using the special "not a number" value
as an argument to primitives that expect a number may cause an
error, but you can test the value reported by this primitive to
filter out "not a number" values. A value that is not a
number will be neither less than nor greater than a number value,
so you can detect "not a number" values using the
following:

```
let value gis:raster-sample dataset turtle 0
; set color to blue if value is a number, red if value is "not a number"
ifelse (value <= 0) or (value >= 0)
[ set color blue ]
[ set color red ]
```

If the requested location is a point, the sample is always computed
using the method set by [set-sampling-method](#gisset-sampling-method). If the
requested location is an area (i.e., an envelope or patch), the
sample is computed by taking the average of all raster cells
covered by the requested area.



### `gis:raster-world-envelope`

```NetLogo
gis:raster-world-envelope *RasterDataset* *x* *y*
```


Reports the GIS envelope needed to match the boundaries of NetLogo
patches with the boundaries of cells in the given raster dataset.
This envelope could then be used as an argument to [set-transformation-ds](#gisset-transformation-ds).

There may be more cells in the dataset than there are patches in
the NetLogo world. In that case, you will need to select a subset
of cells in the dataset by specifying which cell in the dataset you
want to match with the upper-left corner of the NetLogo world.
Cells are numbered from left to right, and from top to bottom,
beginning with zero. So the upper left cell is (0, 0), and the
bottom right cell is (`gis:width-of dataset` - 1, `gis:height-of dataset` - 1).



### `gis:create-raster`

```NetLogo
gis:create-raster *width* *height* *envelope*
```


Creates and reports a new, empty raster dataset with the given
number of columns and rows, covering the given envelope.



### `gis:resample`

```NetLogo
gis:resample *RasterDataset* *envelope* *width* *height*
```


Reports a new dataset that consists of the given RasterDataset
resampled to cover the given envelope and to contain the given
number of columns and rows. If the new raster's cells are
smaller than the existing raster's cells, they will be
resampled using the method set by [set-sampling-method](#gisset-sampling-method). If the new
cells are larger than the original cells, they will be sampled
using the `"NEAREST_NEIGHBOR"` method.



### `gis:convolve`

```NetLogo
gis:convolve *RasterDataset* *kernel-rows* *kernel-columns* *kernel* *key-column* *key-row*
```


Reports a new raster whose data consists of the given raster
convolved with the given kernel.

A convolution is a mathematical operation that computes each output
cell by multiplying elements of a kernel with the cell values
surrounding a particular source cell. A kernel is a matrix of
values, with one particular value defined as the "key
element", the value that is centered over the source cell
corresponding to the destination cell whose value is being
computed.

The values of the kernel matrix are given as a list, which
enumerates the elements of the matrix from left to right, top to
bottom. So the elements of a 3-by-3 matrix would be listed in the
following order:
      <table width="25%" border="1" style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;" align="center">
<tr>
  <td> 1 <td> 2 <td> 3 <tr>
  <td> 4 <td> 5 <td> 6 <tr>
  <td> 7 <td> 8 <td> 9 </table>

The key element is specified by column and row within the matrix.
Columns are numbered from left to right, beginning with zero. Rows
are numbered from top to bottom, also beginning with zero. So, for
example, the kernel for the horizontal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator" target="_blank">Sobel operator</a>,
which looks like this:
      <table width="25%" border="1" style="text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;" align="center">
<tr>
  <td> 1 <td> 0 <td> -1 <tr>
  <td> 2 <td> 0 <br> <small>(key)</small> <td> -2 <tr>
  <td> 1 <td> 0 <td> -1 </table>

would be specified as follows:

```
let horizontal-gradient gis:convolve dataset 3 3 [1 0 -1 2 0 -2 1 0 -1] 1 1
```



### `gis:apply-raster`

```NetLogo
gis:apply-raster *RasterDataset* *patch-variable*
```



Copies values from the given raster dataset to the given patch
variable, resampling the raster as necessary so that its cell
boundaries match up with NetLogo patch boundaries. This resampling
is done as if using [resample](#gisresample) rather
than [raster-sample](#gisraster-sample), for the sake
of efficiency. However, patches not covered by the raster are
assigned values of "not a number" in the same way that
[raster-sample](#gisraster-sample) reports values for
locations outside the raster.



### `gis:drawing-color`

```NetLogo
gis:drawing-color
```


Reports the color used by the GIS extension to draw vector features
into the NetLogo drawing layer. Color can be represented either as
a NetLogo color (a single number between zero and 140) or an RGB
color (a list of 3 numbers). See details in the [Colors](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html#colors) section of the
Programming Guide.



### `gis:set-drawing-color`

```NetLogo
gis:set-drawing-color *color*
```


Sets the color used by the GIS extension to draw vector features
into the NetLogo drawing layer. *Color* can be represented
either as a NetLogo color (a single number between zero and 140) or
an RGB color (a list of 3 numbers). See details in the [Colors](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html#colors) section of the Programming Guide.



### `gis:draw`

```NetLogo
gis:draw *vector-data* *line-thickness*
```


Draws the given vector data to the NetLogo drawing layer, using the
current GIS drawing color, with the given line thickness. The data
may consist either of an entire VectorDataset, or a single
VectorFeature. This primitive draws only the boundary of polygon
data, and for point data, it fills a circle with a radius equal to
the line thickness.



### `gis:fill`

```NetLogo
gis:fill *vector-data* *line-thickness*
```


Fills the given vector data in the NetLogo drawing layer using the
current GIS drawing color, using the given line thickness around
the edges. The data may consist either of an entire VectorDataset,
or a single VectorFeature. For point data, it fills a circle with a
radius equal to the line thickness.



### `gis:paint`

```NetLogo
gis:paint *RasterDataset* *transparency*
```


Paints the given raster data to the NetLogo drawing layer. The
highest value in the dataset is painted white, the lowest is
painted in black, and the other values are painted in shades of
gray scaled linearly between white and black.

The *transparency* input determines how transparent the new
image in the drawing will be. Valid inputs range from 0 (completely
opaque) to 255 (completely transparent).



### `gis:import-wms-drawing`

```NetLogo
gis:import-wms-drawing *server-url* *spatial-reference* *layers* *transparency*
```


Imports an image into the NetLogo drawing layer using the
<a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms" target="_blank">Web Mapping Service</a>
 protocol, as defined by the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/" target="_blank">
Open Geospatial Consortium</a>.

The *spatial reference* and *layers* inputs should be
given as strings. The *spatial reference* input corresponds to
the **SRS** parameter to the **GetMap** request as defined in
section 7.2.3.5 of version 1.1.1 of the WMS standard. The
*layers* input corresponds to the **LAYERS** parameter to
the as defined in 7.2.3.3 of version 1.1.1 of the WMS standard.

You can find the list of valid spatial reference codes and layer
names by examining the response to a **GetCapabilities** request
to the WMS server. Consult the relevant standard for instructions
on how to issue a **GetCapabilities** request to the server and
how to interpret the results.

The *transparency* input determines how transparent the new
image in the drawing will be. Valid inputs range from 0 (completely
opaque) to 255 (completely transparent).

The JTS library (the binary file "jts-1.9.jar") is copyright (c) Vivid 
Solutions, and is made available under the following license:

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions. 

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version. 

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
